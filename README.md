## [Project Description]

This represents a preliminary overview of the contextual distribution of Heavy Residue material from building 77 at Çatalhöyük. The goal was to explore how common different material types are in this building, and what their density is. 

## [Dataset]

Data was obtained from the main Çatalhöyük database, available at www.catalhoyuk.com. 
It contains records from 308 samples from building 77 with contextual information and density (weight/litre) for each material type

## [File Structure]
The repository consists of this readme file, a [csv file with data](Building77.csv) and [Jupyter notebook](HR_exploratory_analysis.ipynb) with the preliminary analysis.
